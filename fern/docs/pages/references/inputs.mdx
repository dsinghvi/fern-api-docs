Inputs are settings for a snap-in that allows behavior customization. They're
scoped to either an organization or a user. Organization-scoped inputs remain
common for the organization, while user-scoped settings need to be set for each
user. Each input's schema maps to FieldDescriptor. Snap-ins don't support inputs
of type `date`, `timestamp` or `array` of `booleans`. For complete reference to
other supported global types, refer to the
[DevRev documentation](https://devrev.ai/docs/apis/beta-api-spec#/schemas/schema-field-descriptor).


For example, if an organization input to select a part and a user input to select an array of enums need to be implemented:

```yaml
inputs:
    organization:
        - name: part_picker
          description: Input that chooses a part in the organization
          field_type: id
          id_type:
            - product
            - capability
            - feature
            - enhancement
          is_required: true
          default_value: don:core:dvrv-us-1:devo/XXXX/product:XXXX
          ui:
            display_name: Part Picker
    user:
        - name: enum_list_picker
          description: Input to select multiple enums
          field_type: array
          base_type: enum
          allowed_values:
            - value-1
            - value-2
            - value-3
          is_required: true
          default_value: value-1
          ui:
            display_name: Enum List Picker
```

## 👉 Getting started

If you are new to DevRev, we would recommend learning about our [core concepts](https://docs.devrev.ai/intro) before getting started.

Once you have a DevRev account, you can access the APIs with a [personal access token](./authentication) (PAT) that you create in the DevRev app.

A brief [tutorial](/welcome/getting-started) shows you how to access the APIs.

## 🧬 Methods

Specifications covering the supported APIs are based on OpenAPI Specification 3.0. You can download the specs to use an OpenAPI 3.0-compliant tool to perform a variety of actions, including rendering them in UI and generating SDKs. Two [versions](./versioning) of the DevRev API are available: [public](https://devrev.ai/docs/apis/methods) and [early access/beta](https://devrev.ai/docs/apis/beta-api-spec). Descriptions of the public [entities](./entities) are available.

To take action based on events from the DevRev platform, [webhooks](./webhooks) are also supported. 

## 🧩 Snap-ins

Numerous snap-ins are available on the DevRev [Marketplace](https://devrev.ai/marketplace). The [snap-in framework](./snapin-concepts) is available for you to create your own snap-ins for automation of DevRev workflows or integration with other system.
